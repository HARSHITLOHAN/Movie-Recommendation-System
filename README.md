# Movie-Recommendation-System

Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is a personalized web application designed to recommend movies based on user preferences using collaborative filtering algorithms. It leverages data analysis to provide personalized movie suggestions, offering an enhanced user experience.

This project was developed using a combination of HTML/CSS, Tailwind CSS, MovieAPI, Git, Jupyter, and Flask to create a seamless and intuitive movie recommendation platform.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Recommends movies based on user preferences and behavior.

Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes collaborative filtering algorithms to predict movie ratings based on historical data.

Intuitive User Interface: Developed using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design to provide an easy-to-use experience.

Movie Data Analysis: Analyzes movie ratings and preferences using Python and machine learning libraries to make accurate predictions.

Seamless Interaction: Users can easily input their movie preferences and receive recommendations in real-time.

Technologies Used
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for designing the frontend with a focus on responsiveness and usability.

MovieAPI: Used to fetch movie data and integrate it into the system.

Python: Core language for implementing machine learning algorithms and recommendation logic.

Flask: A lightweight web framework used to create the backend API and serve the frontend.

Jupyter: For interactive data analysis and prototyping of machine learning models.

Git: Version control for tracking changes and collaboration.

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Flask

Jupyter

Tailwind CSS

Any movie data API (e.g., MovieAPI)

How It Works
The system takes user input in the form of movie preferences and behavior (e.g., liked movies, ratings).

The Collaborative Filtering algorithm analyzes the data and identifies similarities between users.

The system uses these insights to recommend movies that align with the user's tastes.

The frontend provides an interactive user interface that displays the recommended movies.
